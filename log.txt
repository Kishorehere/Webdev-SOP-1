Answer to the question: 
EGG.

Reason:
It is a fact that all species on earth have been arised from new species.
In the same way, two different (non-chicken) species must have generated a 
different kind of egg from which the first ever chicken must have arived on earth.
The question about what came first still remains controversial, if i had to choose one,
i will always go for an EGG.
