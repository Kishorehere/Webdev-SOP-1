The very first chicken would have been the result of a genetic mutation taking place in the zygote produced by two proto-chickens ( chicken like species having closest resemblance ).This means two proto-chickens mated, combining their DNA together to form the very first chicken.So it is obvious that the egg came before the chicken.
Amniotic eggs showed up roughly 340 million years ago and chickens started to evolve at around 58 thousand years ago .So we can say that egg showed up first.
